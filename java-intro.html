~~Statements~~
- direct the operation of the program.
- end with a semicolon ;
- can be grouped as

~~Comments~~
- used to document what the code does
- written for other programmers who may need to maintain your code, and your future self

~~Syntax~~
- a single-line comments begins with two slashes (//)
- a block comment starts with a slash and an asterisk and ends with the same to symbols in reverse (/* */)

~~DATA TYPES~~
Primitive and reference types
- Primitive types:
	- int, char, double, etc.
	- variables that hold a primitive type have a value
- Reference types:
	- refer to an object
	- class objects, and various type of array variables
	- default is null

There are 8 primitive data types:

TYPE    BYTES   DESCRIPTION
byte    1       very short integers from -128 to 127
short   2       short integers from -32,768 to 32,767
int     4       integers from -2billion to 2billion
long    8       long integers from -9quadrillion to 9quadrillion
float   4       single-precision, floating-point numbers from -3.4E38 to 3.4E38
double  8       double-precision, floating-point numbers from -1.7E308 to 1.7E308
char    2       a single unicode character that is stored in two bytes
boolean 1       a true or false value


~~Variables~~
- all variables have a type
- used to store data
- must be declared with a data type before use
- in order to initialize a variable, we have to assign ia a value

SEPARATE
int the Answer;
String question;

theAnswer = 42;
